# Metro-Parking-App
 An app developed using Java which requests the current parking status of the Sydney Metro Car Parks using the public CarParkAPI
 
 # Issues
 I am currently getting a 501 response from the server (too many requests), however, I've done some testing using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and I should only be requesting once on startup. I am in the process of adding a refresh function to confirm.
